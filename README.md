# 5-year-E-BIZ-TREND
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a 5-year e-business income trend across various channels, including ATM, POS, Cards, Remittance, E-payment, E-collection, and Mobile services. Using Power BI and Excel, the data was analyzed to uncover trends and the impact of management changes on business performance. 

Findings:
In this analysis, I examined the 5-year trend of e-business income across various channels such as ATM, POS, Cards, Remittance, E-payment, E-collection, and Mobile. The key findings are as follows:

Deterioration Under New Management:
The data clearly shows a decline in income across all e-business channels starting in 2022, coinciding with the change in management. This trend suggests that the new management's strategies may not be as effective in maintaining or growing the business income.
Overall Income Trend:
Prior to 2022, the e-business channels demonstrated steady growth. However, the trend reversed post-2022, indicating potential issues with operational efficiency, strategic direction, or market conditions under the new management.
